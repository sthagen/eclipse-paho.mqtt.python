## Contributing a change

1. [Fork the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python/fork)
2. Clone the forked repository onto your computer: ``` git clone
   https://github.com/<your username>/paho.mqtt.python.git ```
3. Most changes will go to branch ``master``. This include both bug fixes and
   new features. Bug fixes are committed to ``master`` and if required,
   cherry-picked to the release branch.

   The only changes that goes directly to the release branch (``1.4``,
   ``1.5``, ...) are bug fixes that does not apply to ``master`` (e.g. because
   there are fixed on master by a refactoring, or any other huge change we do
   not want to cherry-pick to the release branch).
4. Create a new branch from the latest ```master``` branch
   with ```git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME origin/master```
5. Make your changes
6. Ensure that all new and existing tests pass by running ```tox```
7. Commit the changes into the branch: ``` git commit -s ``` Make sure that
   your commit message is meaningful and describes your changes correctly.
8. If you have a lot of commits for the change, squash them into a single / few
   commits.
9. Push the changes in your branch to your forked repository.
10. Finally, go to
	[https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python)
	and create a pull request from your "YOUR_BRANCH_NAME" branch to the
	``master`` (or release branch if applicable) to request review and
	merge of the commits in your pushed branch.


What happens next depends on the content of the patch. If it is 100% authored
by the contributor and is less than 1000 lines (and meets the needs of the
project), then it can be pulled into the main repository. If not, more steps
are required. These are detailed in the
[legal process poster](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/EclipseLegalProcessPoster.pdf).

Making a release
----------------

The process to make a release is the following:
* Update the Changelog with the release version and date. Ensure it's up-to-date with latest fixes & PRs merged.
* Make sure test pass, check that Github actions are green.
* Make a dry-run of build:
   * Build using hatch: ``python -m hatch build``
   * Check with twine for common errors: ``python -m twine check dist/*``
   * Try uploading it to testpypi: ``python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*``
* Bump the version number in ``paho/mqtt/__init__.py``, commit the change.
* Do a GPG signed tag (assuming your GPG is correctly configured, it's ``git tag -s -m "Version 1.2.3" v1.2.3``)
* Push the commit and it's tag to Github
* Make sure your git is clean, especially the ``dist/`` folder.
* Build a release: ``python -m hatch build``
* You can also get the latest build from Github action. It should be identical to your local build:
  https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster
* Then upload the dist file, you can follow instruction on https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives
  It should mostly be ``python -m twine upload dist/*``
* Create a release on Github, copy-pasting the release note from Changelog.
* Announce the release on the Mailing list.
* To allow installing from a git clone, update the version in ``paho/mqtt/__init__.py`` to next number WITH .dev0 (example ``1.2.3.dev0``)
